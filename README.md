# Contact Website


This is my first full stack project, the current focus is to set up all routes and functionality to the project, then implement styling.

The project is built using Node.JS and Express.JS with a MongoDB database to store the data from the website, user information and the contacts stored by the users.

# How to use
The user is met with a log in / registration page and when authenticated will be directed to a page that shows all of the contacts stored by the user, all of these contacts can be edited and deleted.

# Caution
This is not a project that currently implements any security measures, the accounts and information are very vulnerable when deployed. This is a basic project in web development, do not use this to store any real personal information.
